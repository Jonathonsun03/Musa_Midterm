- [ ] Report
  - [X] Intro
  - [ ] Data
	- [ ] Brief overview of data collection
	- [ ] Table of summary statistics w/ variable descriptions, sorted by category (internal, amenities/public services, spatial structure)
	- [ ] Correlation matrix
	- [ ] 4 home price correlation scatter plots - looking for interesting open data
		- [ ]
		- [ ]
		- [ ]
		- [ ]
	- [ ] 1 map of home prices (dependent variable)
	- [ ] 3 maps of the 3 most interesting independent variables
		- [ ]
		- [ ]
		- [ ]
	- [ ] Any other charts/maps of interest
  - [ ] Methods
	- [ ] Discussion of modeling methods for a lay-person
  - [ ] Results
	- [ ] Split toPredict == 0 into training and test datasets
	- [ ] Polished table of the summary for the model for the training set
	- [ ] RESULTS OF CROSS-VALIDATION TESTS 
		- [ ] Mean and Standard deviation MAE - use 100 folds and plot cross-validation MAE as a histogram
	- [ ] Plot of predicted prices as a function of observed prices
	- [ ] Map of residuals for test set
		- [ ] Moran's I of test model
		- [ ] Plot of spatial lag in errors
	- [ ] Map of predicted values for all homes
	- [ ] Map of MAPE by neighborhood for test set
	- [ ] Scatterplot of MAPE (per neighborhood) as a function of mean price by neighborhood
	- [ ] Test generalizability on two groups (i.e. race/income)
  - [ ] Discussion
	- [ ] Effective?
	- [ ] More interesting variables?
	- [ ] How much variation could be explained?
	- [ ] What were the more important features?
	- [ ] Causes of error in predictions
	- [ ] Account for spatial variation in prices?
	- [ ] Where does model predict well? poorly? Why?
  - [ ] Conclusion
	- [ ] Recommend to Zillow?
	- [ ] Improvements?
